## Hacker News - Dark Theme FH

A userscript to install a Firehawke-customized dark theme for [Hacker News] (http://news.ycombinator.com).

So, why this fork of the [original userscript](https://github.com/dparpyani/HackerNews-DarkTheme)? The author of these modifications has severe light sensitivity, but felt the need to adjust the contrast levels for text, links, and other important parts of the page. After making a number of adjustments, he decided to make this fork to keep his changes easier to maintain.

### Installation

1. Download [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (Firefox) or [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) (Chrome).
2. Download the userscript from [here](./theme.user.js?raw=true).
